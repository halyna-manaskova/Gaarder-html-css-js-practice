    <h1>Sophie´s World</h1>
    <h2>Novel about the history of philosophy</h2>
    <h3>Jostein Gaarder</h3>
    <p><bold>Sophie's World</bold> (Norwegian: <em>Sofies verden</em>) is a 1991 novel by Norwegian writer Jostein Gaarder. It follows Sophie Amundsen, a Norwegian teenager who is introduced to the history of philosophy by Alberto Knox, a middle-aged philosopher.

          Sophie's World became a best-seller in Norway and won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis in 1994. The English translation was published in 1995, and the book was reported to be the best-selling book in the world in that year. 
        By 2011 the novel had been translated into fifty-nine languages, with over forty million print copies sold. It is one of the most commercially successful Norwegian novels outside of Norway, and has been adapted into a film and a PC game.

        <h2>The storie</h2>
        <p>  A page-turning novel that is also an exploration of the great philosophical concepts of Western thought, Sophie's World has fired the imagination of readers all over the world, 
        with more than twenty million copies in print.

        One day fourteen-year-old Sophie Amundsen comes home from school
         to find in her mailbox two notes, with one question on each: 
        <em>"Who are you?"</em> and <em>"Where does the world come from?"</em> 
        From that irresistible beginning, Sophie becomes obsessed with questions that take her far beyond what she knows of her Norwegian village. 
        Through those letters, she enrolls in a kind of correspondence course, 
        covering Socrates to Sartre, with a mysterious philosopher, while receiving 
        letters addressed to another girl. 
        Who is Hilde? And why does her mail keep turning up? To unravel this riddle, 
        Sophie must use the philosophy she is learning―but the truth turns out to be far more 
        complicated than she could have imagined.(Text from
